Even without having the verified deal manager, you can have up to two numbers per WABA.<br/><br/>The first 1,000 conversations each month are free. That way, you can create experiences that customers will love before they pay for it. Each WhatsApp Business (WABA) account will receive 1,000 free conversations per month that can be initiated by the business (if you do not have the verified manager, you must pay attention to the limitation of 50 conversations with different numbers) or by the user. This benefit is provided at the WABA level. So even if the account has multiple numbers attached, the free chat limit will still be 1,000. The free conversations limit is reset each month according to the time zone associated with WABA.<br/><br/>Also, remembering that with the free plan of Weni Plataforma you can communicate with 200 active contacts (unique contacts in 1 month interval) at no cost.<br/><br/>By checking the business manager you can unlock even more the potential of your WhatsApp integration, such as increasing the conversation tier initiated by the business (1000, 10,000, 100,000 or unlimited), Possibility of acquiring the OBA (official account seal/green ticket) and having more than two numbers per WABA.<br/><br/>This version of the WhatsApp API through the Weni Platform it supports customizations, such as photos, videos, sending files, descriptions and message templates (conversations can be initiated by the user or by the business).",
